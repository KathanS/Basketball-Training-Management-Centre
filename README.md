Repository contains DDL Scripts and triggers for Database and Front End developed for querying database. Front End is developed in Python using PyWebIO library. Sample Dataset is also uploaded for reference purpose.

## Core Idea

For the Basketball Training Management System, we need to constantly monitor the level of skills of players. This must be the focus of our application. To accurately monitor and provide better feedback to players, we should divide training sessions into various types. Players should be graded by a trainer in each session, so that players’ can get continuous reports on improvement in his level in various skills. As a training management centre, the academy should also focus on player’s performance in real matches. Thus, our application also provides functionality to rate a player based on his performance in practice matches as match power skill. Trainers and Head Coach are given the right to give grades to players based on players’ performance in each skill area.
